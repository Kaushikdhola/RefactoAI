# GitLab CI/CD Pipeline Explanation

This `.gitlab-ci.yml` file is a configuration file for GitLab's CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipeline. It defines stages, jobs, and actions that should be performed when certain conditions are met. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the deployment process:

## Stages

The pipeline is divided into four stages: `test`, `quality`, `build`, and `deploy`. Each stage contains one or more jobs that are executed in the order they are defined.

## Variables

Global variables are defined that can be used in any job. For example, `NODE` is defined as `node:19-bullseye` and `FRONTEND_BUILD_PATH` as `static/refactor-ui/build/`.

## Include

This section includes external CI/CD configuration files. Here, `Code-Quality.gitlab-ci.yml` is included.

## code-test Job

This job runs in the `test` stage. It uses a Python image to run tests. The `before_script` section sets up the environment, and the `script` section runs the tests.

## code_quality Job

This job runs in the `quality` stage. It uses a Docker image to check the code quality. The `artifacts` section specifies that the quality report should be saved as an artifact.

## app-build Job

This job runs in the `build` stage. It uses a Node.js image to build the frontend application. The `before_script` section sets up the environment, and the `script` section builds the application.

## backend-deploy Job

This job runs in the `deploy` stage. It uses an Alpine image to deploy the backend application to a server. The `before_script` section sets up the environment, and the `script` section deploys the application.

## frontend-deploy Job

This job also runs in the `deploy` stage. It uses a Node.js image to deploy the frontend application to Netlify. The `before_script` section sets up the environment, and the `script` section deploys the application.

Each job has `tags` that can be used to select specific runners, `rules` that determine when the job should be run, and `needs` that specify dependencies between jobs.
