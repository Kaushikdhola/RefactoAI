On install, they will be prompted to authorize the app to have a read and write access of the all repositories or only the selected repositories. The read premissions is required to read the last committed files and write premissions is used to refactor the files and generate pull request with refactored code.

    After installation from marketplace, the user will be redirected to the Re-Facto website or can login using their GitHub credentials, ensuring a secure and seamless authentication process. Upon successful authentication, they are directed to the dashboard where they can see insights of the refactored code and pull request information generated by the bot for every repository configured by the user. 

  
3. ### **Configuring settings for the Re-facto bot**

    * **Commit Intervals:** Ensure the controlled bot activation based on the defined commit intervals by the user.
    * **Minimum Lines:** Setting a minimum lines threshold ensures the bot activates only when commits has minimum lines of modified code.
    * **Select Repository:** Specify the repository on which bot should run with defined configurations.
    * **Select Branch to Track:** Extra level of specification in the specified repository to ensure the activation of bot when the code changes triggered in the defined branch.
    * **Select your Target Branch:** Generates a pull request to merge the refactored code to the user defined target branch.

4. ### **Approving the pull request on GitHub**
    When a Re-Facto bot raises a pull request, the user can manually reviews the refactored code in order to ensure quality of code. If user satisfies with the code quality then PR can be approved. However, the repository owner has the ability to reject a pull request if it breaks code quality rules.
